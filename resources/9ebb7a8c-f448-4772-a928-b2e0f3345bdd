R. Church,</p><p>My dear Sir:</p><p>The privilege I take in sending you this letter is warranted by such a sacred relationship between your daughter and myself that I do not feel that it is necessary for me to apologize for it. With Miss Mollie's full consent and approval I write to ask of you her hand in marriage. On our part this is no hasty step. We feel that we know each other thoroughly</p><p>well, and loving each other as we do, it is only natural that we should look forward to a union which we are confident will be one of contentment and happiness. From a material standpoint my present condition in life is fairly good and I have as no reason to despair of doing well in the future. In writing to you on a subject of this nature it is my duty to speak of my affairs some- what in detail. I have to say, therefore, that my accumulations amount to about two thousand dollars and my present position pays me two thousand a year. With this start and with judicious management on my part, I shall be able to support your daughter well and save something out of my salary besides. I will say further that I am not wholly dependent on political office for a living. If the Administration should change in 1893, from Republican to Democratic, I have the profession of law on which to fall back. I trust, Mr. Church, that you will give your consent to an engagement</p></div></body></text>
